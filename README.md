# Description
Using MySQL's sample database __sakila__ - a schema that contains random data on a rental company and it's customers, films, payments, etc., you will read various SQL queries to display that data in many different ways. Without further ado here are those queries and the tables generated by them.

## Queries

```sql
USE sakila;

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM  actor;
```
<p align="left">
  <img src="./images/query_1.png" width="200" height="300">
</p>


```sql
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)) AS `Actor Name`
FROM actor;
```
<p align="left">

</p>


```sql
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE first_name = "Joe";
```
<p align="left">

</p>


```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE "%GEN%";
```
<p align="left">
  <img src="./images/query_4.png" width="200" height="110">
</p>


```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE "%LI%"
ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;
```
<p align="left">

After adding middle_name column to actor table.
```sql
ALTER TABLE actor
    DROP COLUMN middle_name;
```
<p align="left">
  <img src="./images/query_8.png" width="470" height="320">
</p>


Removing the added column from the actor table.
```sql
ALTER TABLE actor
    DROP COLUMN middle_name;
```
<p align="left">

</p>


```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(last_name) AS multiples
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name;
```
<p align="left">
  <img src="./images/query_10.png" width="200" height="300">
</p>


```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(last_name) AS multiples
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
    HAVING multiples > 1;
```

After modifing actor 172's name.
```sql
UPDATE actor
SET first_name = "HARPO"
WHERE actor_id = 172;
```
<p align="left">

</p>

Using conditionals to modify actor 172's name.
```sql
UPDATE actor
SET first_name = IF(first_name="HARPO", "GROUCHO", "MUCHO GROUCHO")
WHERE actor_id = 172;
```
